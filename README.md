# Codecool Online Shop

**Description**

The skeleton code (main page with static data) was provided by Codecool. The task was to implement the functions of a webshop and also implement the database and the UI for shopping cart and checkout and payment. 

However, the payment is not implemented yet but it stores the orders in the database. 


The project is also deployed at Heroku:
